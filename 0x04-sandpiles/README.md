# 0x04. Sandpiles

## TASK: SANDPILE SUM

Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles

- Prototype: void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);
- You can assume that both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable
- A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
